<h1>X-mas Tree but Rustaceans</h1>
Nothing here, I just do a little practice in Rust on the X-mas day and got this.

<h2>Function</h2>

This function is going to generate a x-mas tree with height of n.
```rust
fn xmas_tree(n: i32) {...}
```

<h2>Output</h2>

```bash
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
    |
    v
```
Merry x-mas!!!
